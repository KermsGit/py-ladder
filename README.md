Ladder brings us back to the days of classic computer games. Back when computer games were written without any fancy graphics. Heck, they were written without any graphics at all!
Using only ASCII characters, ladder was an addictive game that was very popular for computers running the CPM operating system. Seeing the game, you might be very much reminded of "Donkey Kong".
Now Ladder has been rewritten in Python and can be played on most of today's computers. This version includes all the original levels.
